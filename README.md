# Volition File Format Documentation

The intention here is to collect all knowledge of file formats used in Volition games into one book so one doesn't have to search random source code or disorganized forum posts for information.

Read it online at the [GH pages](https://saintsrowmods2.github.io/volition-docs/), or download the repo and view it offline using MkDocs.
